# p5.js exploration: random walk and mouse dragging

This was originally a small project exploring random walks, plotting the history of those random walks and mouse dragging. Currently it has evolved into a very bad [agar.io](https://agar.io/) clone, aspiring to [Osmos](https://www.osmos-game.com/) fame.
